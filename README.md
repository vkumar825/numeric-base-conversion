# numeric-base-conversion

This is a second version of my previous project, base-conversion which was console based. In this version, it has a functional GUI to input your value, and your starting base you want to convert from, and it has a dropdown menu to choose what base you want it to convert to. 

Like the console version, it may not fully account for all types of base conversion yet, but it should most likely work for majority of the conversion with correct result.
